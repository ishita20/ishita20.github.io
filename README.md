# About this project
This project is a simple todo list integrated with Google Places API that reminds you of tasks in your todo list based on places in your vicinity. If you add a task "Withdraw money" and put an ATM tag with it the app will remind you whenever you are near an ATM.

## Project Structure
* The ***todo_project*** folder is an API written in node to interact with mongoDB using mongoose. The API has not been used in the final project though.
* The ***index.html*** is the webpage.
* The ***display.css*** is the styling of the webpage.
* The ***main.js*** file hits the Google Places API and notifies the user about places in their vicinity where they can get their tasks completed.
